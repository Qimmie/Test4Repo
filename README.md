# Test-AboutMe-2nd RepoEntry
Here is a brief note from me, to help you get to know me  + I am making sure I know what I am doing here at CapitalOne. (:
Here is my scope at work: I have been a Project Manager, Test Eningeer and Technical Writer since 1999. I like learning new things and creating opportunites for small businesses; I like to make business dreams come true.

I avoid fried foods, but I love to Cook!
I am doing more walking with hopes to lose about 10lbs a month for the next 5mths; feel free to ask me to walk with you!
